# Outpass App

## Project Motivation and Background

During my undergraduate years, I faced the inconvenience of having to physically check the notice board downstairs to know the dates for outpass visits in the hostel. This process was time-consuming and inefficient, especially as the outpass days were different for boys and girls. Additionally, the manual posting of dates on the notice board each month resulted in unnecessary paper wastage.

To address these issues, I developed the Outpass App. This Android application allows the admin to input outpass dates into a Firebase database, which are then displayed in the app for students. The app highlights the relevant dates based on the student's year and gender, streamlining the information retrieval process.

## Technology Used

1. **Android Studio (Java):** The app is developed using Android Studio with Java as the programming language.
2. **Realtime Firebase Database:** Firebase is utilized for storing and retrieving outpass dates in real-time.

## Project Structure

- **Working Demo:** Contains the working demo, APK file, and screenshots of the Outpass App.
- **Outpass:** The source code for the Outpass App.

## Contribution
